My Personal Puppet Repo
------------------

This puppet repo is used to configure and setup my many computers and VM's. I
opted to use the role/profile model as I have experience in this model, the only
execption is that I dont define nodes to a role, instead I apply the role to a
device.

# How to setup:

Ill add some content here another day.
